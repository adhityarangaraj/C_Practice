# C_Practice
C programming exercises and practice problems from first-year coursework and personal experiments.
This repository contains my C programming exercises during my first year at SASTRA University. 
It includes topics like loops, arrays, strings, sorting, searching, and basic pointer usage.

Purpose:
- Strengthen C fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving skills
- Prepare for DSA and future projects

I will continue updating this repo weekly with new exercises and small projects.
